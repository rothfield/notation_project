# Auto-Patch Scripts & Code Migrations

This directory contains auto-generated patches, migration tools, and patching scripts.

Patches are scripts designed to:
- Automatically modify codebases.
- Apply bulk changes or structural edits.
- Be executed directly (often via LLM-assisted workflows).

## Purpose:
- Automate code transformations.
- Safely track reproducible patches.
- Keep patch logic organized and maintainable.
