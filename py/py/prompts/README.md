# LLM Prompt Templates

This directory contains prompt templates used for LLM-based tasks.

Prompts are static text-based instructions provided to LLMs to guide their behavior or output.
These are *inputs* to AI modelsâ€”examples include:

- Notation processing prompts
- Structure parsing prompts
- Document labeling prompts

## Purpose:
- Store reusable LLM prompts.
- Version and track LLM input designs separately from code.
- Enable reproducibility in AI-assisted workflows.
