Sure — here’s a **plain text summary** you can use or include in your system prompt docs:

### 📄 Patch File Format Summary

All patches are written as **self-executing Fish shell scripts**, not traditional `.diff` files.

#### ✅ Requirements:

* Begin with `#!/usr/bin/env fish`
* Include a `# PATCH_MSG:` comment near the top
* Use `begin ... end > file` to create or overwrite files
* Prompt the user before overwriting any existing file
* Use plain `git add` and `git commit -m` commands at the end
* Save the script to the `patches/` directory with a `.fish` extension

#### ⚠️ Restrictions:

* Do **not** use unified `diff` format or `patch -p1`
* The patch script itself is what gets committed — not the files it creates

This ensures that patches are human-readable, reproducible, and traceable as standalone artifacts.
